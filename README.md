# DinoReactProject
This is a project from the Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp created with CodeSandbox.  Project is written in React.js.
The contents of the project will seem sporatic and have difficult flow but within the code itself will have many comments describing what is going on and how to correctly implement CSS styles and well as inline styling.  This project will be more of a reference for future projects.
